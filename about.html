        <h2>About AYUSH</h2>
        <p>
            AYUSH stands for Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy. These traditional systems of medicine, primarily practiced in India and neighbouring countries, offer holistic approaches to health and wellness. They emphasize the harmony between mind, body, spirit, and the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core principles often involve natural treatments, lifestyle modifications, dietary regulations, and the use of medicinal plants and herbs, which have been documented and utilized for centuries. Each system has its unique philosophy and approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ayurveda:</strong> Focuses on balancing the body's doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) through diet, herbs, and lifestyle practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Yoga & Naturopathy:</strong> Emphasize physical postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and natural therapies for overall well-being and disease prevention.</li>
            <li><strong>Unani:</strong> Based on the teachings of Greek physicians like Hippocrates and Galen, it involves balancing the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile).</li>
            <li><strong>Siddha:</strong> Originating in Tamil Nadu, it focuses on achieving physical and spiritual perfection through herbs, minerals, and yogic practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Homoeopathy:</strong> Based on the principle of "like cures like," using highly diluted substances to stimulate the body's healing response.</li>
        </ul>
