        <div class="plant-info-block">
            Wild lettuce (Lactuca virosa), also known as Opium Lettuce or Poisonous Lettuce, is a biennial plant recognized by its tall stature, spiny leaves, and milky sap (latex). It resembles cultivated lettuce but is bitter.
        </div>

        <div class="plant-info-block">
            <strong>USES:</strong> Historically, the dried latex (lactucarium) was used as a sedative and pain reliever, acting as a mild substitute for opium. Traditionally employed for coughs, anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness. Modern use is less common due to variability and potential side effects.
        </div>

        <div class="plant-info-block">
            <strong>Health Benefits (Traditional/Potential):</strong> The lactucarium contains compounds believed to have sedative and analgesic (pain-relieving) effects. It may help promote relaxation and sleep and reduce pain perception. However, potency varies greatly, and scientific evidence is weak compared to established medicines.
        </div>

        <div class="plant-info-block">
            <strong>Precautions:</strong> Can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and potentially respiratory depression in high doses. Should *not* be used by pregnant or nursing women. Avoid if allergic to related plants (like daisies). Can cause skin irritation. Due to its effects and variability, use is generally discouraged without expert guidance. **Never confuse with edible lettuce.** Consult a healthcare professional before considering use.
