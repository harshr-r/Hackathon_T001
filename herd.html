            Herb Robert (Geranium robertianum) is a herbaceous plant in the geranium family, characterized by its small pink flowers, reddish stems, and distinctively scented, fern-like leaves. It often grows in damp, shady places.

        <div class="plant-info-block">
            <strong>USES:</strong> Traditionally used as an astringent, antiseptic, and styptic (stops bleeding). Applied externally to wounds, bruises, and skin conditions. Sometimes used internally for diarrhea or as a general tonic. Also known as an insect repellent due to its scent.
        </div>

        <div class="plant-info-block">
            <strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Contains tannins, volatile oils, and other compounds contributing to its astringent and potential antioxidant and immune-modulating properties. Traditional uses suggest benefits for wound healing and reducing minor inflammation. Scientific validation is limited.
        </div>

        <div class="plant-info-block">
            <strong>Precautions:</strong> Generally considered safe for topical use, though some may find the scent unpleasant. Internal use should be done cautiously and preferably under guidance. Pregnant or nursing women should avoid internal use due to lack of safety data. Avoid if allergic to geraniums.
